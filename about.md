# About me

Hi, I'm weeklies. I'm a self-taught developer of mobile and web knick-knacks. In my free time, I enjoy building apps in Flutter and writing.

I make games under the name Bildungsroman, which means “coming of age” in literature. My work as an indie developer is focused on narratives of growth and self-discovery, with an emphasis on player choice. Currently, I am working on a mobile-first visual novel about witches, school life and magical secrets. (Think _Mystic Messenger_ meets _My Hero Academia._)

I started programming with a love for visual novels and writing. Even though I've read and played much over the years, games that are inclusive and have the imagination to display the vividness of our world and its potential are still rare. It is my wish to contribute to such works one day.

If you would like to chat, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://fandom.ink/@{{ site.mastodon }}) or send me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}). (Please be nice—as a wise saying goes, “Let's be excellent to each other.”)
